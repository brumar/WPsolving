# Introduction  
This repository aims the simulation of some human solving behavior in problem solving.
There is a fair amount of scientific litterature on arithmetic word problem solving. If you are new to this field and want to dig it, I strongly recommend the book of Stephen K.Reed (Word Problems: Research and Curriculum Reform) which is a good read whatever the cognitive psychology background you have.

# Goal
The goal is to investigate the source of errors during Word Problem solving.
Two models are built and tested against a large dataset of errors. 
A keyword strategy and a reinterpretation strategy are implemented. Few variations exist for each of these models and are also tested against data.

# Context of this work
This work has been done during my PhD thesis. This is tied to one of my three "contributions chapters". The two others are also stored on Github. The objective of my PhD Thesis was to allow a stronger link between cognitive modeling and student modeling (in particular with the Word Problem field). One comes from cognitive psychology, the other from the learning environnement research.

# Using the code
Few Ipython notebooks (files with ipynb extension) are available at the root of this project. They illustrate how to use the library that has been built. A more massive file, main.py, can serve the same purpose as it is the script used to validate the models on the problems considerered.

# Statistical Analysis
Here again, notebooks play an important role. Knitr has been used to compare predictions of the models and generate nice html output. In order to let the user browse the huge file created, I insered some css/javascript in order to get a dynamic Table Of Content as a sidebar. The statistical Analysis has some subtleties as a stratified permutation test has been used and a specific methodology used to compare models is set up. Interesting results has been drawn frome these analysis.

# Important note
Please note I do not own the dataset used to evaluate the relevancy of the predictions of these models.
If you want to use it for research mater, please contact me in order to reach the person owning the dataset.

# Last thing
Opening a research project is not an easy task. Please contact me if you are interested but have some difficulties to understand what's going on in this project or for any other reason related to the repository.
